# macroCalculator
This a project using HTML, CSS and vanilla JS with a fetch() API to calculate your daily calories based off inputs and then offer an option to search meals.
I enjoyed the challenge of processing which variables will be needed to provide the optimal results for the user's daily caloric needs through the JS as well as the structuring of the calculator itself.
